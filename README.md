# README for LPM

#### This repo is for Parker MacCready's analysis code.  It it meant to be an updated version of ptools.  Code here may often assume it is being run in the (loenv) python environment, and has access to things like the modules in the lo_tools package.

#### Some of the directory structure may mimic that in LO, as needed, and may write to LO_output or LPM_output as convenient.
