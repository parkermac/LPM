"""
Test of reading and plotting the CUSP coastline.

Data source:
shoreline.noaa.gov/data/datasheets/cusp.html

Spatial Reference: Geographic coordinate system (decimal degrees);
Horizontal Datum â€“ North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83)

Tidal Datum: Where applicable, CUSP will reference a mean-high water shoreline
based on vertical modeling or image interpretation using both water level stations
and/or shoreline indicators.

Interesting issue: no coastline around Skagit River and that part of Whidbey basin.
It is listed as "in progress" on the CUSP site.

Performance:

Takes 20 sec for the initial reading, but after that the list append and plot
steps are very fast.  Final vector length is about 3.6 million point pairs.
