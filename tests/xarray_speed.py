"""
Test of the speed of different ways of accessing data using xarray.

RESULT: when we are asking for just a small part of the array, like one
z level, the results are VERY different:

Indices before values takes 0.006 sec
Values before indices takes 0.154 sec

If we are asking for the whole array it makes no difference at all.
