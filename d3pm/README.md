#### This folder is for development of javascript programs using D3.js.

To start a server, in the terminal do:

**cd3** (alias for navigation to Documents/d3pm)

**lhost** (alias for python -m http.server 8000, ctrl-c to exit)

Then in a browser go to:

localhost:8000

and it opens index.html from this folder. Or to open a different page just go to something like localhost:8000/test0.html.

VS Code Notes:

Chrome Notes:
